# MoveSinglePicture

- In this tutorial we will moving a single dynamically drawn image across the screen on all 4 directions using the arrow keys.
- For any games development project player movements are very important.
- We are experimenting with moving images not by using picture boxes but by drawing them directly to the form.
- This way we can draw multiple images on the screen as you may have seen in the particle effects tutorials we have done before.
- This tutorial will explore how to give control the user and move an image inside of the form using the key down and key up events.
- We will also make use of the timer and the paint event in windows form.
- We wonâ€™t be using any extra libraries or frameworks for this, we will only using C# and  Visual Studio. Lets get started.
